# DerrivedMetricAgent Quick Starter Guide

This agent allows to perform aggregation functions using a custom Groovy DSL on metric data returned by the AppDynamics REST Query interface (https://github.com/Appdynamics/RestMetricQueries). After performing the aggregations the resulting values will be reported back into an AppDynamics controller as custom metrics.
